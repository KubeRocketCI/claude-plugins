# KRCI Plugin Inventory — Agents, Commands, Skills

Complete map of the KubeRocketCI Claude Code marketplace. Use this to give the user the exact handle to invoke. Counts and contents reflect the marketplace at the time of writing; if a plugin has changed, prefer what is actually installed.

> **Maintenance:** this inventory is hardcoded. When a plugin is added, removed, or its agents/commands/skills change, update the **three** hand-maintained surfaces together: this file, the `/krci-help:help` command (`commands/help.md`), and the marketplace manifest (`.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`).

Legend: **DEV** = writes/reviews code or config (assumes a codebase). **AGNOSTIC** = planning/analysis/testing/writing artifacts (any project). **META** = describes the ecosystem.

- **Use when**: building or fixing a portal screen, form, table, route, or Kubernetes resource UI.

### krci-devops — DEV
CI/CD pipeline and component development.
- **Agent** `devops`: Tekton pipeline/task onboarding, trigger configuration, GitLab CI components (EDP-Tekton repo).
- **Commands**: `/krci-devops:add-pipeline`, `add-task`, `add-trigger`, `add-gitlab-component`.
- **Skills**: `edp-tekton-standards`, `edp-tekton-triggers`, `gitlab-ci-component-standards`.
- **Use when**: onboarding a Tekton pipeline/task, wiring a VCS webhook trigger, building a GitLab CI component.

### krci-architect — DEV
Cross-repo architecture and planning.
- **Agent** `architect`: plans features/epics, makes architectural decisions, coordinates across repos (portal, operators, tekton) by delegating to specialized agents.
- **Commands**: `/krci-architect:plan-feature`, `technical-review`, `bootstrap-workspace`.
- **Skills**: `krci-architecture` (reference architecture, DevSecOps, deployment patterns), `agent-delegation` (multi-repo coordination via the Task tool).
- **Use when**: a feature spans multiple repos, you need a design before coding, or you need a multi-repo workspace.

### krci-general — DEV (utility, cross-cutting)
General code utilities, any language, any stage.
- **Agent** `code-reviewer`: finds bugs, security risks, and convention violations with confidence-based filtering (reports only confidence ≥ 80).
- **Commands**: `/krci-general:commit` (conventional commit from staged changes), `/krci-general:review` (3 parallel review agents: simplicity, bugs, conventions).
- **Use when**: writing a commit message or reviewing code at any point in the pipeline.

## META plugin

### krci-help — META (this plugin)
Describes the ecosystem and the SDLC framework.
- **Command** `/krci-help:help`: dry, caveman-style map of all plugins, agents, skills, and the SDLC pipeline.
- **Agent** `advisor`: routes the user to the right plugin/agent/skill and sequences end-to-end pipelines; consumes the `krci-sdlc-framework` skill (this one).
- **Use when**: the user is unsure which plugin fits, wants the big-picture workflow, or wants a runnable end-to-end pipeline.
